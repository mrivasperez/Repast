## About
Repast is a responsive, single-page application to search for a sumptuous meals. It provides you with a list of meals based on search terms and when you select a meal it provides you with their ingredients and instructions to prepare. It also has the functionality to generate a random meal by clicking on the random (shuffle) button. 

I used the [themealdb.com](www.themealdb.com) API along with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to built this app.
